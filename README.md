Adventures with a Macbook m1


Virtual machines on an M1 Macbook.

Virtualbox does not currently run on an M1 Mac.
UTM does and seems pretty good.   (This is what I am using)
Paralells and _____ also exist.

To install UTM
Go to the Mac App Store and search for "UTM Virtual Machines" and install it.
